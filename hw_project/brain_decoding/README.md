# fMRI Brain Decoding with Manifold Learning 

Brain decoding, also known as neural decoding or brain reading, is a field of neuroscience that focuses on using patterns of brain activity to infer what a person is seeing, thinking, or feeling. The idea is to decode or interpret the neural signals that are generated by the brain in response to different stimuli or cognitive processes. We use fMRIs and explore different methods to address this tasks in this project.
